                BYU-Idaho. I specialize in innovative software development,
                creative web solutions, and impactful design to help clients

            <img src="images/nigeria.jpg" alt srcset>
            <p>Nigeria, located in West Africa, has a rich history dating back
                to ancient civilizations like the Nok culture and powerful
                kingdoms such as Oyo, Ife, and Kanem-Bornu. Colonized by Britain
                in the 19th century, it was amalgamated in 1914 and gained
                independence on October 1, 1960. Post-independence, Nigeria
                faced ethnic tensions, a civil war (1967â€“1970), and years of
                military rule before transitioning to democracy in 1999. Today,
                it is Africa's most populous country, known for its cultural
                diversity, oil wealth, and global influence in music, film, and
                literature.
